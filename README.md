# Taking a new approach to learning Python

Hey there.

I'm trying something different here. I've been learning Python and, honestly, the standard way of doing things—like making these formal project pages—didn't feel right for me. I wanted to build something that reflects my actual learning journey.

I'm currently working through the **"100 Days of Code" boot camp by Angela in Udemy**, and it's been a great way to refresh my memory and solidify the basics. This series of projects is all about going back to the fundamentals and really getting a feel for the language, one small step at a time. It's proof that it's okay to fall back and build your foundations stronger.

These projects are simple, but for me, they represent progress. This is what I'm learning, and I'm sharing it as I go.

Thanks for checking it out.
